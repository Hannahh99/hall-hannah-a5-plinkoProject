Controls:
Move Player using A & D or LEFT & RIGHT arrows.
Drop Disc with LEFTMOUSE (LEFTCLICK)

Gameplay:
Goal is to drop discs into the bottom spaces. Each has different point values. LOW on the ends, MEDIUM beside the low scorers, and HIGH in the centre. Each corresponds to its size; the smaller it is, the more points are rewarded.

Landing on the first BAT will teleport you to the second, above the HIGH scorer.
Landing on the MOON will bounce and duplicate the disc.
