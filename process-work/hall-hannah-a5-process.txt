Mod Script Process
Teleportation Mod
Attempt 1
- Add Empty "Teleporters", Add Script "Teleportation"
Goal: If disc collides with Bat1, teleport to Bat2
- Add Bat1 and Bat2 rb.position
- Set-up CompareTag for "Disc"
- Issue: Bat1 and Bat2, trying to make it reference scene "Bat1" and "Bat2", but it also must be a vector2?
- Fixed!: Changed Bat1 & Bat2 to trigger colliders, then changed script variable to public Transform "teleportDestination", then in Unity set that to be Bat2.
- New Issue: Disc continues to accelerate as it goes through teleportation points
- Fixed!: Reset velocity on Disc
Complete!

Trampoline Mod
- Does not need script, just add bounciness to collider. New Idea: Duplicate "Disc" on collision with "Trampoline"
Goal: If Trampoline collides with Disc, add 1 Disc
- Added if statement (if ... DuplicateDisc function)
- Added DuplicateDisc function
- Issue: When Disc collides with Trampoline, it duplicates, but it does it a bunch of times and freezes/crashes Unity... Must change to duplicate Disc once.
- Fixed: Offset position & set to only duplicate original Disc.
